# PhD_Guidelines

Successfully completing a PhD requires hard work, dedication and _paperwork_. 
This timeline and set of resources is meant to help you through this process. 
It does not supersede any official requirements specified by the UNC Charlotte Graduate School or the Bioinformatics PhD Handbook.

## The Qualifying Exam

**MILESTONE** This milestone must be completed by the end of the 5th semester 

The major steps are
- [ ] Form your committee
- [ ] Submit your QE Committee Form
- [ ] Create and share your abstract
- [ ] Schedule your written exam
- [ ] Schedule your oral exam
- [ ] Create a short slide presentation
- [ ] Submit the Exam Report of Comprehensive/Qualifying Examination for Doctoral Students
- [ ] Form your Dissertation Committee & Submit the form

### Step 1 - Forming your committee
This committee must consist of only **Bioinformatics	Department	graduate	faculty**. These faculty must include the following expertise. 
1 - Research	advisor
2 - Faculty with teaching focus on computational methods (e.g. programming,	 machine learning, statistics)	
3 - Faculty with teaching focus on computational applications (e.g.	molecular sequence	analysis,	structural	bioinformatics,	genomics)
4 - Faculty of the student’s choice

You should reach out to your potential committee members at least 2-3 months before you aim to take the exam. 

### Step 2 - Submit your Qualifying Exam Committee Form 
Once you have your committee confirmed, you must collect the signatures of all the members on the _Qualifying Exam Committee Form_ via DocuSign and send this to Lauren Slane

### Step 3 - Write your abstract 

This is the one-page description of your current research focus. The faculty crafting questions will use this framework to adapt their question to your proposed research.
Therefore, you should think about this as your opportunity to steer the questions in the direction of your expertise. 

You should also include **a list of the courses you have taken**. This provides the faculty with additional context for crafting your questions

**Send this to your committee when scheduling your written QE**

### Step 4 - Schedule your written exam 

_Do I need a pre-quals meeting with my committee?_ I will leave this up to you. It is possible to schedule a meeting with the committee where you share your work and we brainstorm potential topics for the written exam. This, however, can delay the timing of your exam as it may be difficult to get everyone in a room at the same time. You may want to speak with your committee members to see if they would like to have a pre-quals meeting. 

Your committee members do not need to be present on the date of your written exam. Therefore, you should try to choose a date at least two weeks in advance. Then, email your committee members and ask them to approve the date selected. 

Once you have your date, you must e-mail Lauren Slane with the date so she can set up the Canvas site. 

### Step 5 - Schedule your oral exam

After successful completion of your written exam, you will schedule your oral exam. 
You should schedule **two hours** for the oral exam.

### Step 6 - Create a short slide presentation

At the beginning of your oral exam, you will present _a few_ slides on your proposed research. 
This should be viewed as an opportunity to steer the conversation.

### Step 7 - Submit the Exam Report of Comprehensive/Qualifying Examination for Doctoral Students

After successful completion of the written and oral QE you will submit this form https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=cd5e88b0-1e33-444f-a743-2bfbffb39324&env=na3&acct=59d75bd1-df03-488d-8312-f568329e13f9&v=2

### Step 8 - Form your Dissertation Committee & Submit the form
As you move into dissertation research, you should form your Dissertation Committee as soon as possible. 
You must have a minimum of **four faculty** on this committee. 
- Three Bioinformatics faculty
- One Graduate School representative who is a tenured faculty member from an outside department

To officially create your committee, you must fill out this form: https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=9724b83d-d6f6-4efe-8aa2-30127fc56435&env=na3&acct=59d75bd1-df03-488d-8312-f568329e13f9&v=2
